# REMMA
A [jACT-R](http://jact-r.org/) module for reconstructive eye-movements.

REMMA is inspired by the [EMMA](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~salvucci/publications/Salvucci-CSR01.pdf) module of ACT-R but does only re-generate
durations of fixations input into the model, based on the activation
calculated by the model.
